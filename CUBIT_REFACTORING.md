# Cubit Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the Flutter Coffee App to improve state management by moving hardcoded data and logic from UI screens into dedicated Cubit classes.

## Completed Refactoring

### 1. DashboardScreen Refactoring

**Before:**
- All coffee data was hardcoded in `dashboard_screen.dart`
- State management using `setState()`
- Hardcoded category list
- Manual search functionality

**After:**
- All coffee data moved to `DashboardCubit`
- State management using BlocBuilder pattern
- Categories sourced from cubit state
- Search functionality handled by cubit

### 2. New Cubit Structure

#### Created Files:
- `lib/cubit/dashboard/dashboard_cubit.dart` - Main dashboard business logic
- `lib/cubit/dashboard/dashboard_state.dart` - Dashboard state model
- `lib/cubit/espresso/espresso_cubit.dart` - Espresso screen business logic
- `lib/cubit/espresso/espresso_state.dart` - Espresso state model
- `lib/cubit/coffee_screen/coffee_screen_cubit.dart` - Generic coffee screen logic
- `lib/cubit/coffee_screen/coffee_screen_state.dart` - Generic coffee state model
- `lib/cubit/cubit_exports.dart` - Central export file for all cubits

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### DashboardCubit Features:
- Coffee item management across categories
- Category selection
- Search functionality across all items
- Favorite toggling
- Loading and error state management

#### DashboardScreen Changes:
- Integrated BlocProvider in main.dart
- Used BlocBuilder for reactive UI updates
- Removed all hardcoded data
- Simplified state management

### 4. Cubit Integration

#### main.dart Updates:
```dart
// Added MultiBlocProvider to provide DashboardCubit
MultiBlocProvider(
  providers: [
    BlocProvider(create: (context) => DashboardCubit()),
  ],
  child: MaterialApp(...),
)
```

#### DashboardScreen Updates:
```dart
// Using BlocBuilder for reactive UI
BlocBuilder<DashboardCubit, DashboardState>(
  builder: (context, state) {
    // UI updates automatically when state changes
  },
)

// Dispatching actions to cubit
context.read<DashboardCubit>().selectCategory(index);
context.read<DashboardCubit>().handleSearch(query);
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic separated from business logic
2. **Reusability**: Coffee data and logic can be reused across screens
3. **Testability**: Cubit logic can be unit tested independently
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to business logic don't affect UI code
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features and categories

## Future Enhancements

1. Add persistent storage for favorite items
2. Implement cart functionality using CartCubit
3. Add user preferences cubit
4. Implement offline support
5. Add more filter options

## Testing

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as before while providing better structure:
- Category selection works the same
- Search functionality preserved
- Coffee item display unchanged
- Navigation between screens maintained

## Migration Complete

All hardcoded coffee data has been successfully moved from `dashboard_screen.dart` to `DashboardCubit`, and the UI now uses BlocBuilder pattern for reactive updates.
